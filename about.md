> ### Short Bio
I am currently a Computer Science PhD student at University of
[Wisconsin-Madison][uwm], where and I am fortunate to be advised by Professor
[Christos Tzamos][tzamos-page].  I am particularly interested in algorithms and
learning theory.  Lately, I mostly think about efficient and robust algorithms
for high dimensional inference problems.

Before coming to UW-Madison, I studied Electrical and Computer Engineering at
the [National Technical University of Athens][ece-ntua] where I was very lucky
to be advised by Professor [Dimitris Fotakis][fotakis-page].  You can grab a
copy of my thesis in Greek [here][thesis-link].
